# Exploring Programming concepts
Welcome to **Python Concepts Lab** — a personal and public reference of fundamental and advanced programming concepts explored through hands-on Python code.


📘 Concepts Covered
🔁 Retry Logic
Exponential Backoff – Delay retries with increasing intervals.

Jitter – Add randomness to backoff to avoid thundering herd problem.

🧩 Decorators
Memoization – Cache results of expensive function calls.

Logging Decorators – Automatically log function calls, arguments, and results.

⚙️ Concurrency & Parallelism
AsyncIO Basics – Coroutines, await, and event loops.

Threading vs Multiprocessing – When and why to use each.

Producers/Consumers – Queue-based concurrent processing.

🏗️ Design Patterns
Singleton – One instance to rule them all.

Factory – Create objects without specifying the exact class.

Observer – Subscribe to events or changes in state.

🧠 Algorithms
Two-pointer Technique – Efficient traversal with dual pointers.

Sliding Window – For optimal subarray-type problems.

Binary Search Variants – Lower/upper bounds and recursive versions.

🛠️ Utilities
Timer Context Manager – Time blocks of code with with syntax.

Rate Limiting – Control function call frequency.

Lazy Evaluation – Evaluate expressions only when needed.

🚧 In Progress
This repo is evolving. Expect:

More concepts and real-world use cases

Unit tests and benchmark comparisons

Visual diagrams and cheatsheets
